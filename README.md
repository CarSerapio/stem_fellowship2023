# Implementing a Large Language Model (LLM) for Enhanced Tumour Phenotypic & Treatment Recommendations from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs)
Source code for the Indicium Conference 2023 research project: "Implementing Large Language Model (LLM) for Enhanced Tumour Phenotypic &amp; Treatment Recommendations from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs)â€‹". We use `gpt-3.5-turbo` as our LLM and Flutter to build the front-end for the app. 

Uses `gpt-3.5-turbo` large language model to: 
* extract information from plaintext clinical records
* summarize information for cancers and tumours 
* output treatment plan for clinical decision support

To have access to the front-end of this project, you should download [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and run: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In addition, please set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` either in the environment variable or in `config.json`. If you do not have an OpenAI account with API key, please visit [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api)

macOS(Bash):

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

Windows(Command Prompt):
```
set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

# Usage

To start the app in Flutter and test different models, please run:

```
python model.py
```

or:

```
python model2.py
```
